### 💫 About Me
<p align="justify">
I'm a <strong>Software Engineering learner at ALX</strong> and a <strong>Mechatronics Engineering student</strong> who enjoys learning through doing — from coding and automation to exploring AI and computer-aided design (CAD).  
<br><br>
Before diving fully into software, I spent <strong>4 years managing a cybercafé</strong>, where I handled day-to-day operations, customer support, and system maintenance. I also worked as a <strong>Virtual Assistant </strong>, gaining remote work experience and improving my communication and organizational skills.  
<br><br>
Now, my passion lies in <strong>building tech-driven solutions</strong>, learning continuously, and exploring how <strong>AI, automation, and software</strong> can shape the future of engineering and defense.
